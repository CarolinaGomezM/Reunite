    <h2>Capture and Contain</h2>
    <p>
      If you see a stray pet, try to capture and contain the animal if circumstances permit. Approach slowly and cautiously, speaking in a calm, gentle voice. You can also use food to coax a frightened animal. Avoid scaring or chasing the animal near traffic to prevent injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ideally, secure dogs with a leash or contain them in a fenced yard. A belt or piece of rope can be used as an emergency leash, but keep in mind that these items are not suitable as a routine means of controlling a dog. Most cats do not like to be held for an extended period, so confine stray kittens inside a cat carrier, secure box (with air holes), a small room in your house, or temporarily in your car (if well-ventilated and not too hot).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Call the Authorities</h2>
    <p>
      Never put yourself in harmâ€™s way by attempting to capture an animal behaving aggressively. If you cannot safely approach the animal or if it runs away, call your local animal control or police department immediately. Provide the dispatcher with the exact street address where the animal was last seen.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Check for ID</h2>
    <p>
      Once you have contained the lost pet, check if the animal is wearing an ID tag. If so, you may be able to immediately contact the owner and return the pet. If the pet is wearing ID but you can't immediately contact the owner, you may choose to hold onto the pet for a few hours and wait for a call back from the owner. In this case, it is still advisable to immediately file a "found" report with your local animal shelter in case the owner calls or goes there to search for the pet. If you are unable to hold onto the pet, you can take it to your local animal shelter or call local animal control or the police department for them to pick it up.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Scan for a Microchip</h2>
    <p>
      If the pet does not have an ID tag, the best option is to take it to your local animal shelter or call animal control or the police to pick it up and take it to the shelter. Shelter staff will scan the pet for a microchip. If the pet has a microchip, shelter staff can immediately look up owner contact information by calling the microchip company or accessing the microchip database online. Although it may be tempting to keep a lost pet and try to find the owner on your own, it is absolutely essential to scan the pet for a microchip.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Take Pets without Identification to an Animal Shelter</h2>
    <p>
      If the pet has no ID tag or microchip, its best chance of being reunited with its owner is usually at an animal shelter. The shelter is the obvious place where owners are likely to look for their lost pets. While most shelters maintain a database of "found" reports, these reports are often inaccurate due to the subjectivity of the person describing the animal. Many people are not familiar with breeds and coat colors, and they may not be able to give an accurate description of the found animal. An acceptable alternative would be to post a photo of the found animal in the shelter's computer database if it has software with that capability. This would allow you to retain the lost pet while still allowing the owner to find it at the shelter through a photo.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Post Online or in Local Newspapers</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you keep the lost animal or place it in custody at your local shelter, there are several ways to help find the owner. If possible, take a photo of the pet and put up flyers around the area where it was found. Make sure to distribute flyers to local veterinary clinics as well. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are excellent for sharing information within your local community and with friends. Make the post "public" so that others can also share it. You should also post a "found" report and photo on sites like Petango or Pet FBI. If you found the pet in your own neighborhood, go door-to-door with a photo of the animal and ask if anyone knows the owner. You can also place a "found" ad in the classified section of your local newspaper or post on neighborhood sites like Ring or Nextdoor.
